threesquare
===========

consider magic squares: 
here, a 3x3 grid where all 3-place rows, columns, and diagonals add to the same number
but with the added twist that all the values in the grid are 
squares of some other number, and all values are unique and real.
(so no negatives, repeats or imaginary parts)

The conjecture is that there is some solution. The math minds have not proven it either way as of 2014.

This is just the start of some tools for testing ideas.

in addition to Python, you may need to:

sudo pip install numpy
sudo pip install magic_squares
